## Issue Description

Begin by providing a comprehensive description of the issue and how it manifests itself. (e.g., serviceâ€™s health check will start failing, application/container logs will display several exceptions when trying to instantiate, etc.)

**Optional: User Experience:**
Clearly explain how the issue is impacting the user experience (if there exists a known method to calculate the number of affected users, please provide details).

## Procedural Steps to Restore the Service

Present a step-by-step guide outlining the procedural steps that an engineer should follow in order to restore the service or fix the problem. Each step should be clear, concise, and easy to understand, providing the necessary instructions and actions to be taken.

## Expected Outcome

Clearly state the desired outcome or result that should be achieved once the restoration process is completed successfully. This helps the engineer understand the target state and ensures alignment with the overall objective.

## Verification Process Step(s)

Explain the verification process that needs to be undertaken to confirm whether the restoration process was successful. Outline the specific steps or tests that should be performed to validate that the service is functioning properly or the problem has been resolved.

## Escalation

List the steps to follow if the remediation steps have not helped. This usually involves escalating it to a subject matter expert (team or individuals).

## Miscellanea

Related informational or in-depth documents or artifacts that do not otherwise belong in the playbook itself.
